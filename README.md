# pig-latin-project
Write some code that translates a string (word, sentence, or paragraph) into “pig-latin” using the following rules.
  <ol>
	<li>If start with a consonant have their first letter moved to the end of the word and the letters “ay” added to the end.
	<ul><li>Hello becomes Ellohay</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>Words that start with a vowel have the letters “way” added to the end.
	<ul><li>apple becomes appleway</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>Words that end in “way” are not modified
	<ul><li>stairway stays as stairway</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>Punctuation must remain in the same relative place from the end of the word.
		<ul><li>can’t becomes antca’y</li><li>end. becomes endway.</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>Hyphens are treated as two words.
		<ul><li>this-thing becomes histay-hingtay</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>Capitalization must remain in the same place.
		<ul><li>Beach becomes Eachbay</li><li>McCloud becomes CcLoudmay</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	</ol>
